# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
# Swiggy UI Clone

## Description
This project is a frontend UI clone inspired by the Swiggy food delivery platform. It was built using React and Tailwind CSS to practice component-based design, layout structuring, and modern frontend development concepts.

The project focuses on recreating the visual layout and UI components rather than implementing backend functionality.

## Features
- Swiggy-inspired homepage layout
- Reusable React components
- Menu and restaurant UI sections
- Basic navigation and layout structure

## Tech Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Vite

## Limitations
- This project is not responsive for all screen sizes.
- Backend functionality and real data integration are not implemented.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of React component structure
- Practiced styling using Tailwind CSS
- Learned layout design and UI structuring
- Gained experience organizing frontend project structure

## Future Improvements
- Make the UI fully responsive
- Add backend integration
- Implement dynamic data loading
- Improve UI consistency and animations

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
